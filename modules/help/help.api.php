/**
 * Provide online user help.
 *
 * By implementing hook_help(), a module can make documentation
 * available to the engine or to other modules. All user help should be
 * returned using this hook; developer help should be provided with
 * Doxygen/api.module comments.
 *
 * @param $path
 *   A Drupal menu router path the help is being requested for, e.g.
 *   admin/node or user/edit. If the router path includes a % wildcard,
 *   then this will appear in the path - for example all node pages will
 *   have the path node/% or node/%/view.
 *   Also recognizes special descriptors after a "#" sign. Some examples:
 *   - admin/help#modulename
 *     The module's help text, displayed on the admin/help page and through
 *     the module's individual help link.
 *   - user/help#modulename
 *     The help for a distributed authorization module (if applicable).
 * @param $arg
 *   An array that corresponds to the return of the arg() function - if a module
 *   needs to provide help for a page with additional parameters after the
 *   Drupal path or help for a specific value for a wildcard in the path, then
 *   the values in this array can be referenced. For example you could provide
 *   help for user/1 by looking for the path user/% and $arg[1] == '1'. This
 *   array should always be used rather than directly invoking arg(). Note that
 *   depending on which module is invoking hook_help, $arg may contain only,
 *   empty strings. Regardless, $arg[0] to $arg[11] will always be set.
 * @return
 *   A localized string containing the help text. Every web link, l(), or
 *   url() must be replaced with %something and put into the final t()
 *   call:
 *   $output .= 'A role defines a group of users that have certain
 *     privileges as defined in %permission.';
 *   $output = t($output, array('%permission' => l(t('user permissions'),
 *     'admin/user/permission')));
 *
 * For a detailed usage example, see page_example.module.
