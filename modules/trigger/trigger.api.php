/**
 * Declare information about one or more Drupal actions.
 *
 * Any module can define any number of Drupal actions. The trigger module is an
 * example of a module that uses actions. An action consists of two or three
 * parts: (1) an action definition (returned by this hook), (2) a function which
 * does the action (which by convention is named module + '_' + description of
 * what the function does + '_action'), and an optional form definition
 * function that defines a configuration form (which has the name of the action
 * with '_form' appended to it.)
 *
 * @return
 *  - An array of action descriptions. Each action description is an associative
 *    array, where the key of the item is the action's function, and the
 *    following key-value pairs:
 *     - 'type': (required) the type is determined by what object the action
 *       acts on. Possible choices are node, user, comment, and system. Or
 *       whatever your own custom type is. So, for the nodequeue module, the
 *       type might be set to 'nodequeue' if the action would be performed on a
 *       nodequeue.
 *     - 'description': (required) The human-readable name of the action.
 *     - 'configurable': (required) If FALSE, then the action doesn't require
 *       any extra configuration. If TRUE, then you should define a form
 *       function with the same name as the key, but with '_form' appended to
 *       it (i.e., the form for 'node_assign_owner_action' is
 *       'node_assign_owner_action_form'.)
 *       This function will take the $context as the only parameter, and is
 *       paired with the usual _submit function, and possibly a _validate
 *       function.
 *     - 'hooks': (required) An array of all of the operations this action is
 *       appropriate for, keyed by hook name. The trigger module uses this to
 *       filter out inappropriate actions when presenting the interface for
 *       assigning actions to events. If you are writing actions in your own
 *       modules and you simply want to declare support for all possible hooks,
 *       you can set 'hooks' => array('any' => TRUE). Common hooks are 'user',
 *       'node', 'comment', or 'taxonomy'. Any hook that has been described
 *       to Drupal in hook_hook_info() will work is a possiblity.
 *     - 'behavior': (optional) Human-readable array of behavior descriptions.
 *       The only one we have now is 'changes node property'. You will almost
 *       certainly never have to return this in your own implementations of this
 *       hook.
 *
 * The function that is called when the action is triggered is passed two
 * parameters - an object of the same type as the 'type' value of the
 * hook_action_info array, and a context variable that contains the context
 * under which the action is currently running, sent as an array. For example,
 * the actions module sets the 'hook' and 'op' keys of the context array (so,
 * 'hook' may be 'node' and 'op' may be 'insert').

/**
 * Expose a list of triggers (events) that your module is allowing users to
 * assign actions to.
 *
 * This hook is used by the Triggers API to present information about triggers
 * (or events) that your module allows users to assign actions to.
 *
 * See also hook_action_info().
 *
 * @return
 *   - A nested array. The outermost key defines the module that the triggers
 *     are from. The menu system will use the key to look at the .info file of
 *     the module and make a local task (a tab) in the trigger UI.
 *     - The next key defines the hook being described.
 *       - Inside of that array are a list of arrays keyed by hook operation.
 *         - Each of those arrays have a key of 'runs when' and a value which is
 *           an English description of the hook.
 *
 * For example, the node_hook_info implementation has 'node' as the outermost
 * key, as that's the module it's in. Next it has 'node' as the next key,
 * as hook_node() is what applies to changes in nodes. Finally the keys
 * after that are the various operations for hook_node() that the node module
 * is exposing as triggers.
