 * Inform the node access system what permissions the user has.
 *
 * This hook is for implementation by node access modules. In addition to
 * managing access rights for nodes, the node access module must tell
 * the node access system what 'grant IDs' the current user has. In many
 * cases, the grant IDs will simply be role IDs, but grant IDs can be
 * arbitrary based upon the module.
 *
 * For example, modules can maintain their own lists of users, where each
 * list has an ID. In that case, the module could return a list of all
 * IDs of all lists that the current user is a member of.
 *
 * A node access module may implement as many realms as necessary to
 * properly define the access privileges for the nodes.
 *
 * @param $user
 *   The user object whose grants are requested.
 * @param $op
 *   The node operation to be performed, such as "view", "update", or "delete".
 * @return
 *   An array whose keys are "realms" of grants such as "user" or "role", and
 *   whose values are linear lists of grant IDs.

 * For a detailed example, see node_access_example.module.
