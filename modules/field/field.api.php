 *   - label: The human-readable name of the type.
 *   - object keys: An array describing how the Field API can extract the
 *     informations it needs from the objects of the type.
 *     - id: The name of the property that contains the primary id of the

 *       and its value must be numeric.
 *     - revision: The name of the property that contains the revision id of
 *       the object. The Field API assumes that all revision ids are unique
 *       across all objects of a type.
 *       This element can be omitted if the objects of this type are not
 *       versionable.
 *     - bundle: The name of the property that contains the bundle name for the
 *       object. The bundle name defines which set of fields are attached to
 *       the object (e.g. what nodes call "content type").
 *       This element can be omitted if this type has no bundles (all objects
 *       have the same fields).
 *   - bundle keys: An array describing how the Field API can extract the
 *     informations it needs from the bundle objects for this type (e.g
 *     $vocabulary objects for terms; not applicable for nodes).
 *     This element can be omitted if this type's bundles do not exist as
 *     standalone objects.
 *     - bundle: The name of the property that contains the name of the bundle
 *       object.
 *   - cacheable: A boolean indicating whether Field API should cache
 *     loaded fields for each object, reducing the cost of
 *     field_attach_load().
 *   - bundles: An array describing all bundles for this object type.
 *     Keys are bundles machine names, as found in the objects' 'bundle'
 *     property (defined in the 'object keys' entry above).
 *     - label: The human-readable name of the bundle.
 *     - admin: An array of informations that allow Field UI pages (currently
 *       implemented in a contributed module) to attach themselves to the
 *       existing administration pages for the bundle.
 *       - path: the path of the bundle's main administration page, as defined
 *         in hook_menu(). If the path includes a placeholder for the bundle,
 *         the 'bundle argument', 'bundle helper' and 'real path' keys below
 *         are required.
 *       - bundle argument: The position of the placeholder in 'path', if any.
 *       - real path: The actual path (no placeholder) of the bundle's main
 *         administration page. This will be used to generate links.
 *       - access callback: As in hook_menu(). 'user_access' will be assumed if
 *         no value is provided.
