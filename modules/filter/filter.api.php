/**
 * Define content filters.
 * 
 * Content in Drupal is passed through all enabled filters before it is
 * output. This lets a module modify content to the site administrator's
 * liking.
 *
 * This hook allows modules to declare input filters they provide.
 *
 * A module can contain as many filters as it wants. The 'list' operation tells
 * the filter system which filters are available.
 *
 * Filtering is a two-step process. First, the content is 'prepared' by calling
 * the 'prepare callback' function for every filter. The purpose of the 'prepare callback'
 * is to escape HTML-like structures. For example, imagine a filter which allows the
 * user to paste entire chunks of programming code without requiring manual
 * escaping of special HTML characters like @< or @&. If the programming code
 * were left untouched, then other filters could think it was HTML and change
 * it. For most filters however, the prepare-step is not necessary, and they can
 * just return the input without changes.
 *
 * Filters should not use the 'prepare callback' step for anything other than escaping,
 * because that would short-circuits the control the user has over the order
 * in which filters are applied.
 *
 * The second step is the actual processing step. The result from the
 * prepare-step gets passed to all the filters again, this time with the
 * 'process callback' function. It's here that filters should perform actual changing of
 * the content: transforming URLs into hyperlinks, converting smileys into
 * images, etc.
 *
 * An important aspect of the filtering system is 'text formats'. Every text
 * format is an entire filter setup: which filters to enable, in what order
 * and with what settings. Filters that provide settings should usually store
 * these settings per format.
 *
 * If the filter's behavior depends on an extensive list and/or external data
 * (e.g. a list of smileys, a list of glossary terms) then filters are allowed
 * to provide a separate, global configuration page rather than provide settings
 * per format. In that case, there should be a link from the format-specific
 * settings to the separate settings page.
 *
 * For performance reasons content is only filtered once; the result is stored
 * in the cache table and retrieved the next time the piece of content is
 * displayed. If a filter's output is dynamic it can override the cache
 * mechanism, but obviously this feature should be used with caution: having one
 * 'no cache' filter in a particular text format disables caching for the
 * entire format, not just for one filter.
 *
 * Beware of the filter cache when developing your module: it is advised to set
 * your filter to 'no cache' while developing, but be sure to remove it again
 * if it's not needed. You can clear the cache by running the SQL query 'DELETE
 * FROM cache_filter';
 *
 * @return 
 *  An array of filter items. Each filter item has a numeric key corresponding to the
 *  filter delta in the module. The item is an associative array that may
 *  contain the following key-value pairs:
 *   - "name": Required. The name of the filter.
 *   - "description": Short description of what this filter does.
 *   - "prepare callback": The callback function to call in the 'prepare' step of 
 *     the filtering.
 *   - "process callback": Required. The callback function to call in the 'process' step of 
 *     the filtering.
 *   - "settings callback": The callback function that provides form controls for 
 *     the filter's settings. These settings are stored with variable_set() when
 *     the form is submitted. Remember to use the $format identifier in the variable
 *     and control names  to store settings per text format (e.g. "mymodule_setting_$format").
 *   - "tips callback": The callback function that provide tips for using filters.
 *     A module's tips should be informative and to the point. Short tips are
 *     preferably one-liners.
 *   - "cache": Specify if the filter result can be cached. TRUE by default.
 *
 * For a detailed usage example, see filter_example.module. For an example of
 * using multiple filters in one module, see filter_filter_info().
